ARCHITECURE CHOICES

Separation of Concerns:
UI components are placed in individual widgets (NewsScreen, BookmarksScreen, etc.), while logic such as data fetching and persistence is handled in the respective screen states or helper methods.

State Management:
Minimal built-in StatefulWidget state management is used, as the app is small and doesnâ€™t require complex reactivity. SharedPreferences handles persistence .
Provider is used for changing the theme mode dark and light

Navigation:
Navigator.push is used to navigate to the WebView screen.
DefaultTabController is used to manage tab navigation between News and Bookmarks pages.

No Backend:
Since no backend is required, user login sessions and bookmarks are handled locally using SharedPreferences.
